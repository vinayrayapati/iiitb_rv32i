## 5. SYNTHESIS

### 5.1 Synthesis: 
 Synthesis transforms the simple RTL design into a gate-level netlist with all the constraints as specified by the designer. In simple language, Synthesis is a process that converts the abstract form of design to a properly implemented chip in terms of logic gates.

Synthesis takes place in multiple steps:
- Converting RTL into simple logic gates.
- Mapping those gates to actual technology-dependent logic gates available in the technology libraries.
- Optimizing the mapped netlist keeping the constraints set by the designer intact.

### 5.2 Synthesizer: 
 It is a tool we use to convert out RTL design code to netlist. Yosys is the tool I've used in this project.

The commands to get the yosys is given belw:

```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
make
sudo make install make test
```
Now you need to create a yosys_run.sh file , which is the yosys script file used to run the synthesis.
The contents of the yosys_run file are given below:

```
read_liberty -lib lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog iiitb_rv32i.v
synth -top iiitb_rv32i	
dfflibmap -liberty lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
proc ; opt
abc -liberty lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
clean
flatten
write_verilog -noattr iiitb_rv32i_synth.v
```
Now, in the terminal of your verilog files folder, run the following commands:

```
yosys
script yosys_run.sh
```
Now the synthesized netlist is written in "iiitb_rv32i_synth.v" file.
## 6. GATE LEVEL SIMULATION
GLS is generating the simulation output by running test bench with netlist file generated from synthesis as design under test. Netlist is logically same as RTL code, therefore, same test bench can be used for it.We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it. Also ensuring the timing of the design is met.
Folllowing are the commands to run the GLS simulation:
```
iverilog -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 ../verilog_model/primitives.v ../verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v iiitb_rv32i_synth.v iiitb_rv32i_tb.v
./a.out
gtkwave iiitb_rv32i.vcd
```
The gtkwave output for the netlist should match the output waveform for the RTL design file. As netlist and design code have same set of inputs and outputs, we can use the same testbench and compare the waveforms.

The output waveform of the synthesized netlist given below:
<img width="1130" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-16 at 8 44 34 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/184832803-7b35ffc3-8dcd-4aa4-a214-bd360100f7e8.png">

## 7. PHYSICAL DESIGN 

### 7.1 Overview of Physical Design flow
Place and Route (PnR) is the core of any ASIC implementation and Openlane flow integrates into it several key open source tools which perform each of the respective stages of PnR.
Below are the stages and the respective tools that are called by openlane for the functionalities as described:
- Synthesis
  - Generating gate-level netlist ([yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)).
  - Performing cell mapping ([abc](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)).
  - Performing pre-layout STA ([OpenSTA](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA)).
- Floorplanning
  - Defining the core area for the macro as well as the cell sites and the tracks ([init_fp](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/init_fp)).
  - Placing the macro input and output ports ([ioplacer](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/ioPlacer/)).
  - Generating the power distribution network ([pdn](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/pdn/)).
- Placement
  - Performing global placement ([RePLace](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/RePlAce)).
  - Perfroming detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components ([OpenDP](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenDP)).
- Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
  - Synthesizing the clock tree ([TritonCTS](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/tree/master/src/TritonCTS)).
- Routing
  - Performing global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router ([FastRoute](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/FastRoute/tree/openroad)).
  - Performing detailed routing ([TritonRoute](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonRoute))
- GDSII Generation
  - Streaming out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def ([Magic](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic)).

### 7.2 Openlane
OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, CU-GR, Klayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

More about Openlane at : https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane
### 7.3 Installation instructions 
```
$   apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```
Docker installation process: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

goto home directory->
```
$   git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
$   cd OpenLane/
$   sudo make
```
To test the open lane
```
$ sudo make test
```
It takes approximate time of 5min to complete. After 43 steps, if it ended with saying **Basic test passed** then open lane installed succesfully.

### 7.4 Magic
Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

More about magic at http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/index.html

Run following commands one by one to fulfill the system requirement.

```
$   sudo apt-get install m4
$   sudo apt-get install tcsh
$   sudo apt-get install csh
$   sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
$   sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev
$   sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
$   sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
$   sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
```
**To install magic**
goto home directory

```
$   git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic
$   cd magic/
$   ./configure
$   sudo make
$   sudo make install
```
type **magic** terminal to check whether it installed succesfully or not. type **exit** to exit magic.

### 7.5 Generating Layout

**NON-INTERACTIVE MODE**
Here we are generating the layout in the non-interactive mode or the automatic mode. In this we cant interact with the flow in the middle of each stage of the flow.The flow completes all the stages starting from synthesis until you obtain the final layout and the reports of various stages which specify the violations and problems if present during the flow.

- Open terminal in home directory
  ```
  $   cd OpenLane/
  $   cd designs/
  $   mkdir iiitb_iiitb_rv32i
  $   cd iiitb_iiitb_rv32i/
  $   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinayrayapati/iiitb_rv32i/main/config.json
  $   mkdir src
  $   cd src/
  $   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinayrayapati/iiitb_rv32i/main/iiitb_rv32i.v
  $   cd ../../../
  $   sudo make mount
  $   ./flow.tcl -design iiitb_rv32i
  ```
- To see the layout we use a tool called magic which we installed earlier.Type the following command in the terminal opened in the path to your design/runs/latest run folder/final/def/
 
  ```
  $   magic -T /home/parallels/Desktop/OpenLane/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../../tmp/merged.max.lef def read iiitb_rv32i.def &
  ```

- The final layout obtained after the completion of the flow in non-interactive mode is shown below:

   <img width="622" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-25 at 8 36 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/186565327-8da1d083-e54e-4a39-ad09-21ea755d8f3b.png">

### 7.6 Customizing the layout

Here we are going to customise our layout by including our custom made **sky130_vsdinv cell** into our layout.

- ***1 . CREATING THE SKY130_VSDINV CELL LEF FILE***
   - You need to first get the git repository of the **vsdstdccelldesign**.To get the repository type the following command:

     ``` git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign.git ```
   - Now you need to copy your tech file **sky130A.tech** to this folder.
   - Next run the magic command to open the **sky130_vsdinv.mag** file.Use the following command:
     
     ``` magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_vsdinv.mag& ```
     
     * One can zoom into Magic layout by selecting an area with left and right mouse click followed by pressing "z" key. 
     * Various components can be identified by using the ```what``` command in tkcon window after making a selection on the component.
     
   - The image showing the invoked magic tool using the above command:
     
     ![Screenshot from 2022-08-30 18-04-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187439712-1d3dcbbd-8b00-4eae-a78e-4f19694d4234.png)

   - The next step is setting `port class` and `port use` attributes. The "class" and "use" properties of the port have no internal meaning to magic but are used by the LEF and DEF format read and write routines, and match the LEF/DEF CLASS and USE properties for macro cell pins. These attributes are set in tkcon window (after selecting each port on layout window. A keyboard shortcut would be,repeatedly pressing **s** till that port gets highlighed).
   - The tkcon command window of the port classification is shown in the image below:
          
     ![port_define](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187438423-d08803fb-2375-495b-9de7-c46a2aadda00.JPG)
    
   - In the next step, use `lef write` command to write the LEF file with the same nomenclature as that of the layout `.mag` file. This will create a **sky130_vsdinv.lef** file in the same folder.
   
      ![lef_write](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187439794-340e3c4d-65fc-48ad-8c2b-12ee5054e69f.PNG)
               
- ***2 . INCLUDING THE SKY130_VSDINV CELL***

   - You need to copy the **lib** files and the created **sky130_vsinv.lef** file to your design src directory.The src directory image with its contents is shown below:
     
     ![Screenshot from 2022-08-30 18-07-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187441835-503799ab-801f-4d41-b943-45b3202a7beb.png)

   - Next , Modify the json file by including the following lines:

     ```
     "PL_RANDOM_GLB_PLACEMENT": 1,
     "PL_TARGET_DENSITY": 0.5,
     "FP_SIZING": "relative",
     "LIB_SYNTH":"dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib",
     "LIB_FASTEST":"dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib",
     "LIB_SLOWEST":"dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib",
     "LIB_TYPICAL":"dir::src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib",
     "TEST_EXTERNAL_GLOB":"dir::../iiitb_rv32i/src/*",
     "SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL":"sky130_vsdinv"
     ```
 - ***3 . INTERACTIVE MODE:***
   We need to run the openlane now in the interactive mode to include our custom made lef file before synthesis.Such that the openlane recognises our lef files during the flow for mapping.
      - **1. Running openlane in interactive mode:**
        The commands to the run the flow in interactive mode is given below:
        ```
        cd OpenLane
        sudo make mount
        ./flow.tcl -interactive
        ```
        ![inti_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187484809-0a2ed950-3c75-41cb-91e2-c7a7016a19c0.png)

      - **2. Preparing the design and including the lef files:**
        The commands to prepare the design and overwite in a existing run folder the reports and results along with the command to include the lef files is given below:
        ```
        prep -design iiitb_rv32i -tag run -overwrite
        set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
        add_lefs -src $lefs
        ```
        ![prep_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187484861-5521fcbd-0e3a-49ca-8b72-a85b6d89c2cf.png)

  - ***4 . SYNTHESIS:***
      * **1. The command to run the synthesis** is ```run_synthesis```.This runs the synthesis where yosys translates RTL into circuit using generic components and abc maps the circuit to Standard Cells.
         ![syn_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187484962-90619f3a-0996-4b05-9813-1647f91505a0.png)

      * **2. The synthesized netlist** is present in the results folder and the stats are present in the reports folder as shown below:
        
         ![stat_syn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187448071-82e73b3c-2e9e-4f10-b636-a13bdb566986.png)
      * **3. Calcuation of Flop Ratio:**
  
        ```
  
        Flop ratio = Number of D Flip flops 
                     ______________________
                     Total Number of cells
  
        ```
      * **4. The slack report** including the **sky130_vsdinv** cell is shown below:
        
         ![slack_vsd_syn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187448346-260fb8ff-eef9-47b4-9096-facc01f395e3.png)
        
  - ***5 . FLOORPLAN***
      
      * **1. Importance of files in increasing priority order:**

        1. ```floorplan.tcl``` - System default envrionment variables
        2. ```conifg.tcl```
        3. ```sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl```
        
      * **2. Floorplan envrionment variables or switches:**

        1. ```FP_CORE_UTIL``` - floorplan core utilisation
        2. ```FP_ASPECT_RATIO``` - floorplan aspect ratio
        3. ```FP_CORE_MARGIN``` - Core to die margin area
        4. ```FP_IO_MODE``` - defines pin configurations (1 = equidistant/0 = not equidistant)
        5. ```FP_CORE_VMETAL``` - vertical metal layer
        6. ```FP_CORE_HMETAL``` - horizontal metal layer
           
        ```Note: Usually, vertical metal layer and horizontal metal layer values will be 1 more than that specified in the file```
        
      * **3. To run the Floorplan use the command:** `run_floorplan`.
         ![fp_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187485235-86a1f9ac-8b09-4e53-9bb2-c118bf10c0c2.png)

      * **4. Post the floorplan** run, a `.def` file will have been created within the `results/floorplan` directory. 
        We may review floorplan files by checking the `floorplan.tcl`. 
        The system defaults will have been overriden by switches set in `conifg.tcl` and further overriden by switches set in `sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl`.
        
      * **5. To view the floorplan:** Magic is invoked after moving to the ```results/floorplan``` directory,then use the floowing command:
        ```
        magic -T /home/vinay/OpenLane/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.nom.lef def read iiitb_rv32i.def &
        ```

  - ***6 . PLACEMENT***
         
      * **1. The next step in the OpenLANE ASIC flow is** placement. The synthesized netlist is to be placed on the floorplan. Placement is perfomed in 2 stages:
        1. Global Placement: It finds optimal position for all cells which may not be legal and cells may overlap. Optimization is done through reduction of half parameter wire length.
        2. Detailed Placement: It alters the position of cells post global placement so as to legalise them.
         
      * **2. To run the Placement use the command:** `run_Placement`.

      * **3. Post placement:** the design can be viewed on magic within ```results/placement``` directory.
        Run the follwing command in that directory:
        ```
        magic -T /home/vinay/OpenLane/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.nom.lef def read iiitb_rv32i.def &

  - ***7 . CLOCK TREE SYNTHESIS***
         
      * **1. The purpose** of building a clock tree is enable the clock input to reach every element and to ensure a zero clock skew. H-tree is a common methodology followed in CTS.
        Before attempting a CTS run in TritonCTS tool, if the slack was attempted to be reduced in previous run, the netlist may have gotten modified by cell replacement techniques. Therefore, the verilog file needs to be modified using the ```write_verilog``` command. Then, the synthesis, floorplan and placement is run again. 
      * **2. To run CTS use the below command:**
         ```
         run_cts
         ```
          ![cts_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187499041-43537aa2-8968-41e2-93c4-9edb006ad9d8.png)

  - ***8 . ROUTING***
          
      * **1. OpenLANE uses the TritonRoute tool for routing. There are 2 stages of routing:**
        1. Global routing: Routing region is divided into rectangle grids which are represented as course 3D routes (Fastroute tool).
        2. Detailed routing: Finer grids and routing guides used to implement physical wiring (TritonRoute tool). 
      * **2. Features of TritonRoute:**
        1. Honouring pre-processed route guides
        2. Assumes that each net satisfies inter guide connectivity
        3. Uses MILP based panel routing scheme
        4. Intra-layer parallel and inter-layer sequential routing framework
      * **3. Running routing step in TritonRoute as part of openLANE flow:**
        ```
        run_routing
        ```
         ![rout_term](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079631/187501879-562c5dca-0fbb-4e62-8554-21f24ffbde1e.png)

      * **4. *Do know*  in routing stage**
         1. `run_routing` - To start the routing
         2. The options for routing can be set in the `config.tcl` file. 
         3. The optimisations in routing can also be done by specifying the routing strategy to use different version of `TritonRoute Engine`. There is a trade0ff between the optimised route and the runtime for routing.
         4. The routing stage must have the `CURRENT_DEF` set to `pdn.def`.
         5. The two stages of routing are performed by the following engines:
              - Global Route   : Fast Route
              - Detailed Route : Triton Route
         6. Fast Route generates the routing guides, whereas Triton Route uses the Global Route and then completes the routing with some strategies and optimisations for finding the best possible path connect the pins.
       * **5. Layout in magic tool post routing:** the design can be viewed on magic within ```results/routing``` directory.
         Run the follwing command in that directory:
         ```
         magic -T /home/vinay/OpenLane/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.nom.lef def read iiitb_rv32i.def &
